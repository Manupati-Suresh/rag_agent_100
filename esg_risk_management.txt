ESG RISK ASSESSMENT FRAMEWORK
=============================

RISK IDENTIFICATION PROCESS
---------------------------
1. STAKEHOLDER MAPPING
   - Identify all relevant stakeholders
   - Understand stakeholder concerns and expectations

3. RISK INVENTORY
   - Catalog all potential ESG risks
   - Consider industry-specific risks
   - Include emerging and evolving risks

4. SCENARIO ANALYSIS
   - Develop multiple risk scenarios
   - Consider different time horizons
   - Assess potential impact under various conditions

RISK EVALUATION METHODOLOGY
---------------------------
PROBABILITY ASSESSMENT:
- Very Low (1-5%): Unlikely to occur
- Low (6-25%): May occur in exceptional circumstances
- Medium (26-50%): May occur at some time
- High (51-75%): Will probably occur
- Very High (76-100%): Expected to occur

IMPACT ASSESSMENT:
- Negligible: Minimal impact on operations or reputation
- Minor: Limited impact with manageable consequences
- Moderate: Noticeable impact requiring management attention
- Major: Significant impact affecting business performance
- Severe: Critical impact threatening business viability

RISK RATING MATRIX:
Risk Level = Probability Ã— Impact
- Low Risk: Scores 1-6
- Medium Risk: Scores 8-15
- High Risk: Scores 16-25

TIME HORIZON CONSIDERATIONS:
- Short-term: 0-2 years
- Medium-term: 2-5 years
- Long-term: 5+ years
