                policies addressing climate change, energy use, waste, pollution, natural resource conservation, 
                and treatment of animals. Social criteria examine how a company manages relationships with

                employee relations, diversity, human rights, consumer protection, and community development. 
                Governance deals with a company's leadership, executive pay, audits, internal controls,

                This involves stakeholder engagement, peer benchmarking, and risk assessment. Next, companies
