While not directly about starting a program, it implies understanding *why* you need to report ESG information is crucial.\n*   **Key Questions (ESG Disclosure Handbook):** The handbook outlines key questions that can guide the process:\n    *   Why report ESG information? (Key Question 1)\n    *   For whom should ESG information be reported? (Key Question 2)\n    *   Where should ESG information be reported? (Key Question 3)\n    *   What ESG information should be reported? (Key Question 4)\n    *   How should ESG information be prepared and presented? (Key Question 5)\n    *   How much ESG information should be reported?

They don't offer granular details on specific frameworks (like GRI, SASB, TCFD), specific metrics to track, or in-depth guidance on materiality assessments.
